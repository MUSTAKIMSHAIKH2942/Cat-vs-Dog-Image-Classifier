# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

A complete implementation of an image classifier using TensorFlow and Keras with Factory Design Pattern.

## Project Structure

## Features

- Factory Design Pattern implementation for model creation
- Proper data preprocessing pipeline
- Modular code structure
- Training visualization
- Model saving and loading

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Copy

## Usage

1. Place your raw cat and dog images in `data/raw/kagglecatsanddogs_3367a/PetImages/Cat` and `Dog` folders
2. Run the main script:
python main.py

Copy

## Results

The model will be saved in `models/cat_dog_classifier.h5` and training curves will be displayed.
